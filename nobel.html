His family was descended from Olof Rudbeck, the best-known technical genius in Sweden in the 17th century, an era in which Sweden was a great power in northern Europe. Nobel was fluent in several languages, and wrote poetry and drama. Nobel was also very interested in social and peace-related issues, and held views that were considered radical during his time. Alfred Nobel’s interests are reflected in the prize he established. Learn more about his life and his interests – science, inventions, entrepreneurship, literature and peace work.</p>

      <p class="chitietcacgiaithuong">When his brother Ludvig died in 1888 , many early obituaries confused Alfred Nobel's death, which is said to be what led him to decide to leave a better legacy to the world after his death. The obituary in a French newspaper read Le marchand de la mort est mort (Dead merchant) and went on to say, "Dr Alfred Nobel, who became rich after inventing a way to kill children. who was quicker than ever, passed away yesterday."

        On November 27 , 1895 at the Swedish - Norwegian Club in Paris , Nobel signed his last will and left most of his fortune to establish the Nobel Prizes , which are awarded annually to anyone without distinction. nationality. He died of a stroke on December 10 , 1896 , in Sanremo , Italy . The amount of cash available to the Nobel Prize Foundation is 31 million kronor ($4,223,500.00), 94% of Nobel's assets.
        
        The first three Nobel Prizes were awarded to prominent figures in the physical sciences , in chemistry and in the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ; The fourth prize is for writers whose literary work is "in the direction of an ideology" and the fifth prize is given to the individual or organization that has the best performance in serving the ideal of international friendship. , prevent or reduce standing armies , or establish or promote the progress of peace .
        
        The definition of literary resolution, "in an ideological direction" ( Swedish : i idealisk riktning ), is quite confusing and controversial. For many years, the Swedish Academy interpreted "ideal" to mean "ideal or ideal" (in Swedish idealistisk ) , and used it as a reason to refuse to award prizes to important authors. important but less romantic , like Henrik Ibsen , August Strindberg and Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy . This interpretation has since been changed and the prize has, for example, been awarded to Dario Fo and José Saramago , who are not at all part of the idealist (or idealist) literary school.
        
        When he read Nemesis in the original Swedish language and when looking at his philosophy and literary views, he seemed to be against what he had initially believed - that the prize should be given to authors who had fight for his ideals "against" the powers of God, Church and Country.
        
        The bodies he appointed to award the physics and chemistry prizes also had many interpretations of his opinion, because he did not consult with them before deciding to delegate responsibility. In a one-page will he stipulates that the money is not awarded to discoveries or inventions in the physical sciences and discoveries or improvements in chemistry. He opened a door to engineering prizes, but he left no instructions on how to distinguish between science and engineering. Because the institutions that decide to award prizes in those fields are more interested in science than engineering, it is not surprising that the prizes are awarded to scientists, not engineers and technicians. or other inventors. In a sense the recently announced awards ofThe World Technology Network is an indirect continuation (because it was not created by the Nobel Foundation ) of Nobel's wishes, because he did not include it in his will.
        
        In 2001, his grandson, Peter , asked the Bank of Sweden to distinguish its economists' prize awarded "in memory of Alfred Nobel" from the other five. This has caused much controversy as to whether the present prize in economics is a "Nobel Prize" (see the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel ).</p>

    <p class="caunoinobel">Aphorisms by Alfred Nobel</p>
    <p class="modau">Literature occupied a central role in the life of Alfred Nobel. He regarded various literary forms of expression as opportunities to achieve a greater understanding of our own thoughts, lives and relationships with other people and our surroundings. Alfred Nobel had an extensive library, which included important European literary works. Inspired by Shelley and Byron, he wrote poems in English as a young man. Toward the end of his life, he wrote the tragedy Nemesis. His best literary form of expression was probably the aphorism, where he often expressed himself drastically.</p>
