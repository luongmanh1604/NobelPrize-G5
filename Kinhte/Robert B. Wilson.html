                <h2>Robert B. Willson</h2>
                <p>Nationality: Geneva, United States</p>
                <p>Award year: 2020</p>
                <p>Prize motivation: For improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats</p>
                <p class="cach">Robert Butler Wilson (born May 16, 1937, Geneva, Nebraska), American economist who, with Paul Milgrom, was awarded 
                    the 2020 Nobel Prize for Economics (the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel) for his 
                    contributions to the theory of auctions and for his invention of new auction formats, or rules of operation, for goods and 
                    services that could not be efficiently sold in more traditional types of auction. Since the 1990s Wilson and Milgrom’s 
                    theoretical and practical work has profited both auction buyers and sellers and enabled governments to allocate increasingly 
                    numerous and complex public assets—including radio and broadband frequencies, electricity, airport landing slots, and natural
                     resources—to ensure their efficient use and to maximize their benefits to society.</p>

           <p class="cach">Wilson was born on May 16, 1937, in Geneva, Nebraska. He graduated from Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska and 
            earned a full scholarship to Harvard University. He received his A.B. from Harvard College in 1959. He then completed his M.B.A. in
             1961 and his D.B.A. in 1963 from the Harvard Business School. He worked at the University of California, Los Angeles for a very
              brief time and then joined the faculty at Stanford University. He has been on the faculty of the Stanford Business School since 
              1964. He was also an affiliated faculty member of Harvard Law School from 1993 to 2001.</p>

     <h2>Research and career</h2>

        <div class="chu">
            <p class="cach">Wilson is known for research and teaching on market design, pricing, negotiation, and related topics concerning 
                industrial organization and information economics. He is an expert on game theory and its applications. He has been a major 
                contributor to auction designs and competitive bidding strategies in the oil, communication, and power industries, and to the 
                design of innovative pricing schemes. His work on pricing of priority service for electric power has been implemented in the 
                utility industry.</p>
            <p class="cach">Wilson's 1968 Econometrica paper The Theory of the Syndicates influenced a whole generation of economics, finance,
                 and accounting students. The paper poses a fundamental question: Under what conditions does the expected utility representation 
                 describe the behavior of a group of individuals who choose lotteries and share risk in a Pareto-optimal way?</p>
            
            <p class="cach">He has published about a hundred articles in professional journals and books since completing his education. He has been
                 an associate editor of several journals, and delivered several public lectures.</p>

            <p class="cach">In 1993, Wilson published a book on Nonlinear Pricing. It is an encyclopedic analysis of tariff design and related 
                topics for public utilities, including power, communications, and transport. The book won the 1995 Leo Melamed Prize, a prize 
                awarded biannually by the University of Chicago for "outstanding scholarship by a business professor."</p>  
            </div>
        </div>
            <p class="cach">Other contributions to game theory includes wage bargaining and strikes, and in legal contexts, settlement 
                negotiations. He has authored some of the basic studies of reputational effects in predatory pricing, price wars, and other 
                competitive battles.</p>    

            
        
                
    <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
    <p class="cach">He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, a designated 'distinguished fellow' of the American Economic
         Association, and a fellow, former officer and Council member of the Econometric Society. He was conferred an honorary Doctor of Economics 
         degree in 1986 by the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration. In 1995, he was conferred an honorary Doctor of 
         Laws degree by the University of Chicago. In 2014, Wilson won a Golden Goose Award for his work involving auction design.</p>   
    <p class="cach">He has won the BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award (2015) in the Economics, Finance and Management category for 
        his "pioneering contributions to the analysis of strategic interactions when economic agents have limited and different information about 
        their environment". With colleagues David M. Kreps and Paul Milgrom, he was awarded the 2018 John J. Carty Award for the Advancement of 
        Science.</p>  
    <p class="cach">The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Wilson and Paul Milgrom as the co-recipients of the 2020 Nobel Memorial Prize
         in Economics for having "improved auction theory and invented new auction formats, beneftting sellers, buyers and taxpayers around the
         world".</p>
