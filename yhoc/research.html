                  succeeded in sequencing the genome of the Neanderthal. He also discovered a previously unknown hominin, Denisova. He also found 
                  that gene transfer had occurred from these now extinct hominins to Homo sapiens following the migration out of Africa around 70,000 
                  years ago. This ancient flow of genes to present-day humans has physiological relevance today, for example affecting how our immune 
                  system reacts to infections.</p>

            <div class="chu">
                <p class="cach">Humanity has always been intrigued by its origins. Where do we come from, and how are we related to those who 
                    came before us? What makes us, Homo sapiens, different from other hominins?</p>
                <p class="cach">Through his pioneering research, Svante Pääbo accomplished something seemingly impossible: sequencing the genome
                     of the Neanderthal, an extinct relative of present-day humans. He also made the sensational discovery of a previously unknown
                      hominin, Denisova. Importantly, Pääbo also found that gene transfer had occurred from these now extinct hominins to Homo 
                      sapiens following the migration out of Africa around 70,000 years ago. This ancient flow of genes to present-day humans has
                       physiological relevance today, for example affecting how our immune system reacts to infections.</p>

                </div>

                <p class="cach">Pääbo’s seminal research gave rise to an entirely new scientific discipline; paleogenomics. By revealing genetic
                     differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, his discoveries provide the basis for exploring what
                      makes us uniquely human.</p>

                <p>Nationality: Stockholm, Sweden </p>
                <p>Award year: 2022</p>
                <p class="cach">Svante Pääbo (born 20 April 1955) was a Swedish geneticist and Nobel Laureate who specialises in the field of evolutionary 
                    genetics. As one of the founders of paleogenetics, he has worked extensively on the Neanderthal genome. In 1997, he became founding
                     director of the Department of Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Since 1999, he
                      has been an honorary professor at Leipzig University; he currently teaches molecular evolutionary biology at the university. He is
                       also an adjunct professor at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan. In 2022, he was awarded the Nobel Prize 
                       in Physiology or Medicine "for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution".</p>
