                <h2>Barbara McClintock</h2>
                <p>Nationality: United States</p>
                <p>Award year: 1983</p>
                <p>Prize motivation:  For her discovery of mobile genetic elements</p>
                <p class="cach">Barbara McClintock (June 16, 1902 – September 2, 1992) was an American scientist and cytogeneticist who was 
                    awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. McClintock received her PhD in botany from Cornell University in 
                    1927. There she started her career as the leader of the development of maize cytogenetics, the focus of her research for the 
                    rest of her life. From the late 1920s, McClintock studied chromosomes and how they change during reproduction in maize. She 
                    developed the technique for visualizing maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental 
                    genetic ideas. One of those ideas was the notion of genetic recombination by crossing-over during meiosis—a mechanism by 
                    which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first genetic map for maize, linking regions of the chromosome to
                     physical traits. She demonstrated the role of the telomere and centromere, regions of the chromosome that are important in
                      the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized as among the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships,
                       and elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1944.</p>

        <h2>Education and early life</h2>
        <div id="content">

            <div class="chu">
           <p class="cach">Barbara McClintock was born Eleanor McClintock on June 16, 1902, in Hartford, Connecticut, the third of four children
             born to homeopathic physician Thomas Henry McClintock and Sara Handy McClintock. Thomas McClintock was the child of British 
             immigrants. Marjorie, the oldest child, was born in October 1898; Mignon, the second daughter, was born in November 1900. The 
             youngest, Malcolm Rider (called Tom), was born 18 months after Barbara. When she was a young girl, her parents determined that 
             Eleanor, a "feminine" and "delicate" name, was not appropriate for her, and chose Barbara instead. McClintock was an independent 
             child beginning at a very young age, a trait she later identified as her "capacity to be alone". From the age of three until she
              began school, McClintock lived with an aunt and uncle in Brooklyn, New York in order to reduce the financial burden on her parents
               while her father established his medical practice. She was described as a solitary and independent child. She was close to her
                father, but had a difficult relationship with her mother, tension that began when she was young.</p>
                <p class="cach">The McClintock family moved to Brooklyn in 1908 and McClintock completed her secondary education there at Erasmus
                     Hall High School; she graduated early in 1919. She received a B.S. in 1923, a master’s degree two years later, and, having 
                     specialized in cytology, genetics, and zoology, a Ph.D. in 1927. During graduate school she began the work that would occupy 
                     her entire professional life: the chromosomal analysis of corn (maize). She used a microscope and a staining technique that
                      allowed her to examine, identify, and describe individual corn chromosomes.</p>

     <h2>Research and career</h2>

        <div class="chu">
            <p class="cach">In 1931 she and a colleague, Harriet Creighton, published “A Correlation of Cytological and Genetical Crossing-over 
                in Zea mays,” a paper that established that chromosomes formed the basis of genetics. Based on her experiments and publications
                 during the 1930s, McClintock was elected vice president of the Genetics Society of America in 1939 and president of the Genetics
                  Society in 1944. She received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1933 to study in Germany, but she left early because of the rise of
                   Nazism. When she returned to Cornell, her alma mater, she found that the university would not hire a female professor. The 
                   Rockefeller Foundation funded her research at Cornell (1934–36) until she was hired by the University of Missouri (1936–41).</p>
            <p class="cach">In 1941 McClintock moved to Long Island, New York, to work at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where she spent
                 the rest of her professional life. In the 1940s, by observing and experimenting with variations in the coloration of kernels
                  of corn, she discovered that genetic information is not stationary. By tracing pigmentation changes in corn and using a 
                  microscope to examine that plant’s large chromosomes, she isolated two genes that she called “controlling elements.” These 
                  genes controlled the genes that were actually responsible for pigmentation. McClintock found that the controlling elements 
                  could move along the chromosome to a different site, and that these changes affected the behaviour of neighbouring genes. She
                   suggested that these transposable elements were responsible for new mutations in pigmentation or other characteristics.</p>

            <p class="cach">McClintock’s work was ahead of its time and was for many years considered too radical—or was simply ignored—by her 
                fellow scientists. Deeply disappointed with her colleagues, she stopped publishing the results of her work and ceased giving
                 lectures, though she continued doing research. Not until the late 1960s and ’70s, after biologists had determined that the 
                 genetic material was DNA, did members of the scientific community begin to verify her early findings. When recognition finally
                  came, McClintock was inundated with awards and honours, most notably the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. She was 
                  the first woman to be the sole winner of this award.</p>
         
                
    <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
    <p class="cach">In 1947, McClintock received the Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women. She was elected a 
        Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1959. In 1967, McClintock was awarded the Kimber Genetics Award; three years 
        later, she was given the National Medal of Science by Richard Nixon in 1970. She was the first woman to be awarded the National 
        Medal of Science. Cold Spring Harbor named a building in her honor in 1973. She received the Louis and Bert Freedman Foundation 
        Award and the Lewis S. Rosensteil Award in 1978. In 1981, she became the first recipient of the MacArthur Foundation Grant, and was
         awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research,[73] the Wolf Prize in Medicine and the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal by the
          Genetics Society of America. In 1982, she was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University for her research in
           the "evolution of genetic information and the control of its expression."</p>
    <p class="cach">Most notably, she received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1983, the first woman to win that prize unshared,
         and the first American woman to win any unshared Nobel Prize. It was given to her by the Nobel Foundation for discovering "mobile
          genetic elements"; this was more than 30 years after she initially described the phenomenon of controlling elements. She was compared 
          to Gregor Mendel in terms of her scientific career by the Swedish Academy of Sciences when she was awarded the Prize.</p>   
    
    <p class="cach">She was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1989. McClintock received the Benjamin Franklin Medal
         for Distinguished Achievement in the Sciences of the American Philosophical Society in 1993. She had been previously elected to the APS 
         in 1946. She was awarded 14 Honorary Doctor of Science degrees and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. In 1986 she was inducted 
         into the National Women's Hall of Fame. During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after Evelyn Fox 
         Keller's 1983 biography of her, A Feeling for the Organism, brought McClintock's story to the public. She remained a regular presence 
         in the Cold Spring Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of 
         junior scientists. An anthology of her 43 publications The Discovery and Characterization of Transposable Elements: The Collected Papers
          of Barbara McClintock was published in 1987.</p>
