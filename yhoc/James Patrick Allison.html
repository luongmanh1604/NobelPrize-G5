                <h2>James Patrick Allison</h2>
                <p>Nationality:  Texas, United States</p>
                <p>Award year: 2018</p>
                <p>Prize motivation:  For their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation</p>
                <p class="cach">James Patrick Allison (born August 7, 1948) is an American immunologist and Nobel laureate who holds the 
                    position of professor and chair of immunology and executive director of immunotherapy platform at the MD Anderson Cancer
                     Center at the University of Texas.</p>
                <p class="cach">His discoveries have led to new cancer treatments for the deadliest cancers. He is also the director of the 
                    Cancer Research Institute (CRI) scientific advisory council. He has a longstanding interest in mechanisms of T-cell 
                    development and activation, the development of novel strategies for tumor immunotherapy, and is recognized as one of the 
                    first people to isolate the T-cell antigen receptor complex protein.</p>
                <p class="cach"> In 2014, he was awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences; in 2018, he shared the Nobel Prize in 
                    Physiology or Medicine with Tasuku Honjo.</p>

            <div class="chu">
           <p class="cach">Allison was born on August 7, 1948, in Alice, Texas, the youngest of three sons of Constance Kalula (Lynn) and
             Albert Murphy Allison. He was inspired by his eighth-grade math teacher to pursue a career in science, spending a summer in a 
             National Science Foundation–funded summer science-training program at the University of Texas, Austin, and completing high-school 
             biology by correspondence course at Alice High School. Allison earned a Bachelor of Science degree in microbiology from
             University of Texas, Austin, in 1969, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He earned his doctor of philosophy 
             degree in biological science in 1973, also from UT Austin, as a student of G. Barrie Kitto.</p>
            <p class="cach">At age 15, Allison participated in a science-training program at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), 
                which fueled his already developing interest in science. He later earned a B.S. degree (1969) in microbiology and a Ph.D. (1973) 
                in biological sciences from UT Austin and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation 
                (later renamed Scripps Research Institute) in La Jolla, California. At Scripps, Allison worked primarily on amino acid sequencing
                 but also found time to carry out experiments on immune cell function. These experiments led to his first major discovery 
                 concerning tumour recognition by the immune system.</p>

        <div class="chu">
            <p class="cach">From 1974 to 1977, Allison worked as postdoctoral fellow at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in California.
                 Then he worked as assistant biochemist and assistant professor at MD Anderson to 1984. He was appointed a professor of 
                 immunology and director of the Cancer Research Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley in 1985 and was concurrently 
                 appointed professor at the University of California, San Francisco from 1997.</p>
            <p class="cach">In 2004, he moved to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York City to become the director of
                 the Ludwig Center for Cancer Immunotherapy and the chair of the immunology program as well as the Koch chair in immunologic
                  studies and attending immunologist at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was a professor of Weill Cornell Medicine
                   and co-chair of the Department of Graduate Program in Immunology and Microbial Pathogenesis at Weill Cornell Graduate School
                    of Medical Sciences from 2004 to 2012, and also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) investigator until 2012, when he left
                     to join the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in 2012. Since 2012 he has been chair of immunology at M.D. Anderson.</p>
              
            
            
            <p class="cach">He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine 
                (formerly Institute of Medicine), and is a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology and the American Association
                 for the Advancement of Science. He is director of the Cancer Research Institute scientific advisory council. Previously,
                  he served as president of the American Association of Immunologists.[citation needed] He is on the Research Advisory Board

            <h2>Research</h2>
        <div id="content">

            <div class="chu">
           <p class="cach">Allison trained at Scripps Research under tumor-immunologist Ralph Reisfeld, Ph.D., professor emeritus, researching 
            human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and T-cells and exploring the role HLA proteins play in enabling the immune system to distinguish 
            self from invaders. In 1977, Allison and a colleague, G. N. Callahan, reported in a letter to Nature that they had found evidence 
            that the immune system was prevented from attacking cancer cells due to antigens’ association with additional proteins. Finding the
             factors that inhibited the immune attack on cancer has been key to developing checkpoint-blockade cancer immunotherapies.</p>
            <p class="cach">In 1982, Allison first discovered the T-cell receptor. Allison's research to elucidate mechanisms of T-cell
                responses was conducted in the 1990s at the University of California, Berkeley. In the early 1990s, Jim Allison showed that
                CTLA-4 acts as an inhibitory molecule to restrict T-cell responses. In 1996, Allison was the first to show that antibody blockade of 
                a T-cell inhibitory molecule (known as CTLA-4) could lead to enhanced anti-tumor immune responses and tumor rejection.</p> 
            </div>
        </div>    
            <p class="cach">This concept of blocking T-cell inhibitory pathways as a way of unleashing anti-tumor immune responses and eliciting
                 clinical benefit laid the foundation for the development of other drugs that target T-cell inhibitory pathways, which have been 
                 labeled as "immune checkpoint therapies". This work ultimately led to the clinical development of ipilimumab (Yervoy), 
                 which was approved in 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

                Allison's research is in molecular immunology of the T-cell antigen receptor complex, co-stimulatory receptors, and other 
                molecules involved in T-cell activation. He is particularly interested in finding signals that lead to differentiation of naive 
                T-cells and also those that determine whether antigen receptor engagement will lead to functional activation or inactivation of 
                T-cells. Once defined, the basic studies are used to develop new strategies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and
                 immunotherapy of cancer. Most recently he has been interested in understanding the immune responses in cancer patients who
                  respond to immunotherapy. He established the immunotherapy platform at MD Anderson Cancer Center to study immune responses in
                   cancer patients.</p>
