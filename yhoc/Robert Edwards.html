                <h2>Robert Edwards</h2>
                <p>Nationality: Batley, England</p>
                <p>Award year: 2010</p>
                <p>Prize motivation: For the development of in vitro fertilization</p>
                <p class="cach">Sir Robert Geoffrey Edwards (27 September 1925 – 10 April 2013) was a British physiologist and pioneer in 
                    reproductive medicine, and in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) in particular. Along with obstetrician and gynaecologist Patrick 
                    Steptoe[8] and nurse Jean Purdy, Edwards successfully pioneered conception through IVF, which led to the birth of Louise 
                    Brown on 25 July 1978. They founded the first IVF programme for infertile patients and trained other scientists in their
                     techniques. Edwards was the founding editor-in-chief of Human Reproduction in 1986. In 2010, he was awarded the Nobel
                      Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for the development of in vitro fertilization".</p>

        <h2>Education and early life</h2>

            <p class="cach">Edwards was born in Batley, Yorkshire, and attended Manchester Central High School on Whitworth Street in central
                 Manchester, after which he served in the British Army, and then completed his undergraduate studies in biology, graduating with
                  an Ordinary degree at Bangor University. He studied at the Institute of Animal Genetics and Embryology at the University
                   of Edinburgh, where he was awarded a PhD in 1955 under the supervision of C. H. Waddington.</p> 
            <p class="cach">Edwards grew up in Manchester and served in the British army (1943–48). In 1949 he started to pursue a degree in 
                agriculture at the University of Wales, but he soon switched his major to zoology. After receiving a B.Sc. (1951), he studied mouse 
                embryos, artificial insemination, and infertility at the University of Edinburgh (Ph.D., 1955). Edwards continued his research at the
                California Institute of Technology (1957–58) in the United States, the National Institute for Medical Research, London (1958–62), and 
                the University of Glasgow (1962–63) before joining the faculty at the University of Cambridge in 1963; he retired and became professor
                 emeritus in 1989.</p>

        <div class="chu">
            <p class="cach">After a year as a postdoctoral research fellow at the California Institute of Technology he joined the scientific
                 staff of the National Institute for Medical Research at Mill Hill. After a further year at the University of Glasgow, in 1963
                  he moved to the University of Cambridge as Ford Foundation Research Fellow at the Department of Physiology, and a member of 
                  Churchill College, Cambridge. He was appointed Reader in physiology in 1969.</p>

            <p class="cach">In 1968, the same year Edwards’s partnership with Steptoe began, he succeeded in fertilizing a human ovum outside the
                 womb. Four years later they made their first attempt at implanting human embryos in women but were unsuccessful because of the 
                 hormone regimens they employed, which encouraged the release of multiple eggs (to improve the chances of fertilization) but also 
                 resulted in menstruation at the time of implantation. They ultimately abandoned that approach and instead chose to time the 
                 isolation, fertilization, and implantation of single eggs with the natural ovulation and menstrual cycle. In 1976 they met Lesley 
                 Brown, in whom their natural-cycle approach proved successful. Their work at the Centre for Human Reproduction in Oldham, 
                 England, resulted in the birth of more than 1,000 babies, including Louise Brown’s younger sister. In 1980 Edwards and Steptoe 
                 founded Bourn Hall Clinic in Cambridge.</p>

    <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
    <p class="cach">Edwards and Steptoe chronicled their research on IVF in A Matter of Life: The Story of a Medical Breakthrough (1980). In 2001 
        Edwards received the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award, and in 2006 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Karolinska 
        Institute.</p>   
    <p class="cach">In 2007, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Huddersfield.</p>   
        
    <p class="cach">On 4 October 2010, it was announced that Edwards had been awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the 
        development of in-vitro fertilisation.</p>
