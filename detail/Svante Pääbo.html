                <h2>Svante Pääbo</h2>
                <p>Nationality: Stockholm, Sweden </p>
                <p>Award year: 2022</p>
                <p>Prize motivation: For his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution</p>
                <p class="cach">Svante Pääbo (born 20 April 1955) is a Swedish geneticist and Nobel Laureate who specialises in the field of evolutionary 
                    genetics. As one of the founders of paleogenetics, he has worked extensively on the Neanderthal genome. In 1997, he became founding
                     director of the Department of Genetics at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Since 1999, he
                      has been an honorary professor at Leipzig University; he currently teaches molecular evolutionary biology at the university. He is
                       also an adjunct professor at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Japan. In 2022, he was awarded the Nobel Prize 
                       in Physiology or Medicine "for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution".</p>

           <p class="cach">Pääbo’s parents were scientists, his mother being a chemist and his father, biochemist Sune K. Bergström, having won 
            a share of the 1982 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. Pääbo pursed his own career in the sciences, enrolling at Uppsala 
            University in 1975 for studies in humanities and, later, medicine. In 1981 he joined the Department of Cell Research at Uppsala 
            for graduate studies; his research project centred on elucidating the effects on the immune system of E19, a protein produced by 
            infectious adenoviruses. In 1986, after earning a Ph.D. from Uppsala, he went on for postdoctoral studies, first at the Institute 
            for Molecular Biology II at the University of Zürich and subsequently at the Department of Biochemistry of the University of 
            California at Berkeley. He later served as a professor of biology at the University of Munich and in 1997 was made the director 
            of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig. He later also joined the faculty at the Okinawa Institute of 
            Science and Technology in Japan.</p>

     <h2>Research and career</h2>

            <p class="cach">Early in his career Pääbo became interested in the possibility of gathering DNA from ancient human remains.
                 He showed that cell nuclei that remained intact in the tissues of Egyptian mummies still contained DNA sequences. After 
                 developing techniques to extract and copy DNA from a sample, he determined that New Zealand’s extinct moas and Australia’s 
                 emus were more closely related than moas were to kiwis.</p>
            <p class="cach">Pääbo’s most notable discoveries, however, came after he used DNA extraction and sequencing to examine the 
                relationships between modern and archaic humans. He was the first to sequence a portion of the Neanderthal genome from 
                mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), the results of which revealed that humans (Homo sapiens) and Neanderthals (H. neanderthalensis) 
                are distinct species that diverged from one another by about 500,000 years ago. Pääbo later sequenced the entire Neanderthal 
                genome, which, when compared with the modern human genome, showed an overlap of up to 4 percent with the genome of people of 
                European and Asian descent. This discovery supported the notion that the two species interbred.</p>
            <p class="cach"> Pääbo also sequenced the mtDNA taken from a 40,000-year-old finger bone discovered at the Denisova Cave in Russia.
                 The sequence was so unique that it revealed the presence of a previously unknown hominin species, the Denisovans, who existed 
                 simultaneously with humans and Neanderthals. All three species bred with one another, and modern Southeast Asian and Melanesian 
                 peoples shared up to 6 percent of their DNA with the Denisovans. Pääbo’s work helped to establish the modern discipline of 
                 paleogenomics, in which the genomes of living species and the preserved remains of their extinct ancestors are used to 
                 reconstruct how species and populations evolve across time.</p>

    <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
    <p class="cach">In 1992, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest 
        honour awarded in German research. Pääbo was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2000, and in 2004 was elected 
        an international member of the National Academy of Sciences. In 2005, he received the prestigious Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine.
         In 2008, Pääbo was added to the members of the Order Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts. In the same year, he received the Golden Plate 
         Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In October 2009, the Foundation For the Future announced that Pääbo had been awarded 
         the 2009 Kistler Prize for his work isolating and sequencing ancient DNA, beginning in 1984 with a 2,400-year-old mummy.In June 2010, 
         the Federation of European Biochemical Societies (FEBS) awarded him the Theodor Bücher Medal for outstanding achievements in Biochemistry
          and Molecular Biology. In 2013, he received Gruber Prize in Genetics for groundbreaking research in evolutionary genetics. In June 2015,
           he was awarded the degree of DSc (honoris causa) at NUI Galway. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 2016, and in
            2017, was awarded the Dan David Prize. In 2018, he received the Princess of Asturias Awards in the category of Scientific Research, in
             2020 the Japan Prize, in 2021 the Massry Prize and in 2022 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for sequencing the
              first Neanderthal genome.</p>
