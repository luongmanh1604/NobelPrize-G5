       <div class="pnctlnb">
           The nobel prize is a set of international awards that have been awarded annually since 1901 to individuals who have made achievements in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, economics and peace; especially peace prizes can be awarded to organizations or to individuals.

           <p class="pnccauhoi">How was the nobel prize born?</p>
   
       </div>
       <div class="pnctlnb1">
           After his death in 1896, Alfred Nobel left behind a will that was shocking and confusing for everyone when he gave only a small part of his fortune to friends and relatives so as to "not create enemies." lazy". Nearly all of his assets were sold for cash, equivalent to 70 million Swedish krona at the time, to be deposited in the bank. The annual profit will be extracted and divided into 5 prizes awarded "to those who have made the greatest contribution to humanity" in the fields of: Physics, Chemistry, Biology (or Medicine), Literature, and Peace.

       <div class="pncchnb2">
           <p class="pnccauhoi">How is the Nobel Prize awarded?</p>
       </div>
       <div class="pnctlnb2">
           Among the Nobel prizes, the Physics, Chemistry, Literature and Economics Prizes are decided by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; The Medicine Prize is decided by the Nobel Committee of the Karolinska Institute; and the Peace Prize is decided by the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian Parliament. In September of the year preceding the award year, the Nobel Committee secretly sends nomination forms to 3,000 experts who are former Nobel laureates and members. of the awarding body, experts in the field of physics, chemistry, biology or medicine, leading professors from many universities and research institutes. February of the award year is the deadline. file together. The Nobel committee will screen and select the candidates. The panel then selects between 250-350 shortlisted for the next round. From March to May, experts evaluate the work of the candidates, after which the Nobel Committee nominates the laureates to the Institute. The Academy chooses by majority vote. From June to August, the Nobel Committee assembles the reports with the list of recommendations to send to the Academy. This report was jointly signed by the council members. From September to early October, the Nobel Committee submitted their selections to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and other awarding organisations. . In fact, the awarding unit does not always follow the recommendation of this Committee. In early October, the Academy selected the winners based on a majority of votes, then officially announced the names of the winners. won the prize. Voting to choose the Nobel laureate was kept secret until the end. Every year, before November 15, the Organizing Committee will have to announce the list of recipients of this noble award. According to the rules of the Nobel Committee, information related to the awarding process is kept confidential for 50 years. A Nobel Prize is usually awarded to a maximum of 3 people. If a prize is declined or not accepted, the bonus amount will be paid into the fund. The Nobel Prizes for Medicine, Physics, Chemistry, Literature, Economics are awarded in December in Stockholm, Sweden, and the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony takes place in Oslo, Norway.

           <p class="pnccauhoi">How much is the Nobel Prize worth?</p>
   
       </div>
       <div class="pnctlnb3">
           Each award consists of a gold medal, a certificate of merit and a sum of money. The amount depends on the income of the Nobel Society. Initially, more than three people could receive the same Nobel Prize, although this never happened. The constitution of the Nobel Foundation was amended in 1968 to limit the number of co-recipients to only three people. In that case, each person can get 1/3 of the money or 2 people can split 50% of the bonus while the third person gets the remaining 50%. Occasionally a Nobel Prize is withheld until the following year. If not yet awarded, the bonus amount will be returned to the fund. Therefore, two prizes of the same kind (for example, two physics prizes) can be awarded in one year.
   
               "The undersigned is Alfred Bernhard Nobel. I have given due thought and promulgated a Final Will regarding the disposal of my estate after my death as follows: All that assets are converted to cash, which my agent will safely invest in securities and constitute a type of fund. The profit of the fund is divided into 5 equal parts to reward those who have made the greatest contribution to the benefit of mankind in the previous year, including: The person with the most important discovery or invention in the field of Materials reason; The person with the most important discovery or improvement in the field of Chemistry; The person with the most important discovery in the field of Physiology or Medicine; The person who created the most outstanding literary work in the direction of idealism; The person who has made the greatest or best contribution to the promotion of friendly relations between countries, the elimination or reduction of armaments, the army and in peace conferences. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences considers awards for physics and chemistry; The Stockholm Medical Institute considers awards for physiology or medicine; The Swedish Literary Institute of Stockholm considers and awards literary prizes; The peace prize is awarded by a committee of five people appointed by the Norwegian parliament. My clearest wish is this: when considering giving awards to the above-mentioned persons, there is absolutely no bias in regard to the person's nationality, regardless of whether they are Scandinavian or not (Sweden is on the other side). East of the Scandinavian peninsula in Northern Europe - NV), just they deserve it. The establishment of the above awards is my most urgent desire. This is my only valid Will. After my death, if other previous wills are found to handle my property, those wills are invalid. Alfred Bernhard Nobel November 27, 1895"

         The Nobel Prizes were designated in the will of Alfred Nobel and are in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature and peace. The economics prize was established much later and is a memorial prize, as indicated by its full name: the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. Its addition was an exception, to celebrate the tercentenary of Sweden’s central bank in 1968.
