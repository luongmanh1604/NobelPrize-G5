        <p class="ttchinh">Sully Prudhomme was born in Paris. After an eye disease forced him to discontinue engineering studies, he supported himself for a while as a lawyer. He had already begun writing poetry as a student, and his debut came in 1865. In time he became a respected poet, particularly through induction into the French Academy in 1881. As time passed, his health declined and he lived alone in his home in the southern suburbs of Paris, where he died in 1907. Prudhomme used the money from his Nobel Prize to establish a fund for publishing young French poets.</p>

        <p class="tieude2">Work</p>
        <p class="ttchinh">Sully Prudhomme belonged to the French Parnassian school, a group of poets that, in the tradition of Théophile Gauthier, wanted to write in a classic and formally elegant style. The movement got its name from La Parnasse Contemporain anthology. Prudhomme’s poetry combined a Parnassian regard for formal perfection with an interest in science and philosophy. According to the Swedish Academy, his elevated poetry fit in Alfred Nobel’s formulation about works in an ideal direction.</p>

        <p class="ttchinh">Prudhomme's father died when Prudhomme was two years old, the family situation was difficult, he moved with his mother and sister to live with an uncle. At the age of eight, Prudhomme entered the Lycée Bonapart school . The boy is good at math, passionate about French language and poetry , but eye disease has interrupted his studies. Initially he studied to become a technician. Since 1860, Prudhomme has had to work many jobs for a living, studying philosophy and writing poetry in the evenings. For a time he worked at the steel mill of the Schneider company , then began to study law at a notary's office.

        In 1865 he published his first poetry collection, signed under the pseudonym Sully Prudhomme, which was highly appreciated. The following year, a publisher printed his poetry in Le Parnasse contemporain - a manifesto by Parnasse poets opposed to the Romantic school. The good reception from Conférence La Bruyère (a student organization) encouraged him to pursue a literary career. In 1870, the Franco-Prussian war broke out, he voluntarily joined the militia. The hardships and hardships during the Prussian armyThe blockade of Paris made his already weak health worse, he became paralyzed and had to have his legs amputated after the blockade ended. During the healing period, he still wrote patriotic poetry (Impressions of War, 1872), promoted traditional poetry, opposed free verse, symbolism, decadence: Testament poétique (Poetic Testament, 1901 ) . He was elected to the French Academy in 1881. In 1888 he published the epic Le bonheur (Happiness), consisting of 4,000 verses, claiming that happiness can be achieved through curiosity, through science, through kindness. charity and sacrifice. He was awarded a knighthood of the Legion of Honor in 1895.
            
        In 1901, Prudhomme became the first person to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature "for outstanding literary values, lofty idealism, artistic perfection, and a wonderful combination of affection and talent." He used the money to establish a prize for young poets, presented by the Société des gens de lettres . In 1902, he together with Jose-Maria de Heredia  and  Leon Dierx founded the Société des poètes français (Association of French Poets).
            
        During the last years of his life, Sully Prudhomme's inherent ailing health forced him to stay almost in hiding at Châtenay-Malabry , a suburb of Paris , enduring paralysis while still writing essays. He died suddenly at his home on September 6, 1907 at the age of 68 and was buried in Père-Lachaise , Paris. Prudhomme was unmarried and his nephew Henry Gerbault was his heir.</p>
