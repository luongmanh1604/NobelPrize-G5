    <p class="tieudechung">SUMMARY</p>
    <p class="ttchinh">The 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice for the discovery of Hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis, from the Greek names for liver and inflammation, is a disease characterized by poor appetite, vomiting, fatigue and jaundice – yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes. Chronic hepatitis leads to liver damage, which may progress to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Viral infection is the leading cause of hepatitis, with some forms persisting without symptoms for many years before life-threatening complications develop. Until the 1960’s, exposure to blood from infected individuals was a major health hazard, with up to 30% risk of chronic hepatitis following surgery or multiple blood transfusions. This risk was only partially reduced by the discovery of the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the eventual elimination of HBV-contaminated blood through testing. A more insidious form of hepatitis, characterized by very mild symptoms in the acute phase and a high risk of progression to chronic liver damage and cancer, remained. The work of Alter, Houghton and Rice characterized this form of hepatitis to be a distinct clinical entity, caused by an RNA virus of the Flavivirus family, now known as Hepatitis C virus (HCV). This pioneering work has paved the way for the development of screening methods that have dramatically reduced the risk of acquiring hepatitis from contaminated blood and has led to the development of effective antiviral drugs that have improved the lives of millions of people.

    <p class="tieudechung">Hepatitis – a global threat to human health
    </p>
    <p class="ttchinh">Liver inflammation, or hepatitis, a combination of the Greek words for liver and inflammation, is mainly caused by viral infections, although alcohol abuse, environmental toxins and autoimmune disease are also important causes. In the 1940’s, it became clear that there are two main types of infectious hepatitis. The first, named hepatitis A, is transmitted by polluted water or food and generally has little long-term impact on the patient. The second type is transmitted through blood and bodily fluids and represents a much more serious threat since it can lead to a chronic condition, with the development of cirrhosis and liver cancer. This form of hepatitis is insidious, as otherwise healthy individuals can be silently infected for many years before serious complications arise. Blood-borne hepatitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and causes more than a million deaths per year world-wide, thus making it a global health concern on a scale comparable to HIV-infection and tuberculosis.</p>

    <p class="tieudechung">An unknown infectious agent
    </p>
    <p class="ttchinh">The key to successful intervention against infectious diseases is to identify the causative agent. In the 1960’s, Baruch Blumberg determined that one form of blood-borne hepatitis was caused by a virus that became known as Hepatitis B virus, and the discovery led to the development of diagnostic tests and an effective vaccine. Blumberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1976 for this discovery.
    </p>
    <p class="ttchinh">At that time, Harvey J. Alter at the US National Institutes of Health was studying the occurrence of hepatitis in patients who had received blood transfusions. Although blood tests for the newly-discovered Hepatitis B virus reduced the number of cases of transfusion-related hepatitis, Alter and colleagues worryingly demonstrated that a large number of cases remained. Tests for Hepatitis A virus infection were also developed around this time, and it became clear that Hepatitis A was not the cause of these unexplained cases.</p>
    <p class="ttchinh">It was a great source of concern that a significant number of those receiving blood transfusions developed chronic hepatitis due to an unknown infectious agent. Alter and his colleagues showed that blood from these hepatitis patients could transmit the disease to chimpanzees, the only susceptible host besides humans. Subsequent studies also demonstrated that the unknown infectious agent had the characteristics of a virus. Alter’s methodical investigations had in this way defined a new, distinct form of chronic viral hepatitis. The mysterious illness became known as “non-A, non-B” hepatitis.

    <p class="tieudechung">New antiviral treatments</p>
    <p class="ttchinh">The seminal discovery of HCV by this year’s Nobel Laureates paved the way for the development of effective antiviral drugs. While infectious in primates, the full-length clones generated by Rice exhibited poor replicative capacity in cell lines, which hampered in vitro studies of the virus life cycle and testing of candidate antiviral drugs. This obstacle was overcome thanks the work of Ralph Bartenschlager at the University of Heidelberg in Germany who constructed the first HCV sub-genomic clones that replicated with high efficiency in transfected hepatoma cell lines. Further improvement of the technology, and the identification of virus isolates that could replicate in cell lines without the need for adaptive mutations, led to the production of sub-genomic replicons that upon transfection into hepatoma cells resulted in the secretion of virus particles that were infectious. The second obstacle stems from the very restricted host spectrum of HCV – the virus infects only humans and chimpanzees – and the consequent lack of a small animal models for precise assessment of the pathological and immunological profile of the disease, and for pre-clinical testing of candidate drugs. Progress was made when T- and B-cell deficient mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) could be grafted with human hepatocytes and other models were developed.</p>
    <p class="ttchinh">The availability of in vitro replication systems and the development of small animal models for in vivo studies facilitated the development of highly effective antiviral drugs that have revolutionized the treatment of HCV infection. Earlier therapeutic regiments, including recombinant type I interferon (IFN) and the nucleoside analog ribavirin, were ineffective and associated with significant side effects. Some improvement was made at the end of the 1990s with the introduction of pegylated-IFN and further improvements were made with the introduction of inhibitors of the NS3/NS4A protease, such a beceprevir, teleprevir and sime-previr. The development of drugs that specifically target the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NS5B, e.g. sofosbuvir, and the regulatory replicon protein NS5A, e.g. ledipasvir, constituted major breakthroughs in HCV therapeutics. The combination of drugs that target critical viral functions, collectively known as directly acting antivirals (DAAs), proved to be highly effective, caused only minor side effects and strongly diminished the risk of selecting drug resistant variants of the virus.</p>
    <p class="tieudechung">How is hepatitis C detected  ?</p>
    <p class="ttchinh">Before the hepatitis C virus was discovered, scientists knew about the hepatitis A and B viruses. However, the causative agent of most blood-borne chronic hepatitis cases was still a mystery at that time. number. 

      The researches of Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice helped to detect the hepatitis C virus, which is the most common blood-borne chronic hepatitis virus in the world.
      
      By identifying the hepatitis C virus as the real causative agent of chronic hepatitis, scientists have a basis for finding accurate diagnostic methods as well as effective and life-saving treatments. millions of people around the world.
      
      Hepatitis is a chronic inflammation of the liver caused mainly by viruses. In 1940, two groups of hepatitis were identified. Hepatitis A is mainly transmitted through food and drink and usually does not leave long-term consequences for the patient. Meanwhile, the second type (hepatitis B) is transmitted through blood and body fluids, causing long-term and dangerous consequences such as cirrhosis and liver cancer.
      
      The disease can persist for years without the person knowing it, until severe symptoms appear. This blood-borne hepatitis causes more than 1 million deaths a year worldwide, making it as impactful as tuberculosis or HIV/AIDS.
      
      The first important step took place in the 1960s, when Baruch Blumberg (Nobel Biomedical Sciences 1976) discovered the virus that causes hepatitis B. However, there are still many cases of chronic hepatitis without No specific cause could be found.
      
      Harvey J. Alter, at the National Institutes of Health, was studying patients who developed hepatitis after a blood transfusion. He realized that the blood of these patients could transmit hepatitis to chimpanzees. 
      
      Later studies by him and his colleagues proved that the causative agent of this hepatitis was not caused by hepatitis A or B viruses, two viruses that were found at that time. This demonstrates that there is an unknown pathogen that causes blood-borne hepatitis.
      
      The next breakthrough was made by Michael Houghton, when he found a way to isolate this mysterious virus. He and his colleagues identified virus-specific genetic material in the blood of infected people. Subsequent studies also identified specific antibodies to this virus in patients with chronic hepatitis. The virus was then named hepatitis C virus</p>

  <p class="ttchinh">Building on the findings of Harvey Alter and Michael Houghton, Charles M. Rice and colleagues at Washington University St. Louis studied how the hepatitis C virus reproduces and proved that this virus is the cause of the blood-borne hepatitis C virus.

    The identification of hepatitis C virus is a turning point for the fight against hepatitis in particular and diseases caused by viruses in general.
    
    Through the contributions of Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice, medicine has found a way to detect hepatitis C virus in blood samples and prevent transmission through blood transfusion.
    
    The findings of these three scientists also guide the creation of specific treatments that target the virus and completely cure hepatitis C.
    
    Although it is still necessary to solve the remaining two difficult problems, how to make diagnostic tests for hepatitis C virus and hepatitis C antiviral drugs become popular, especially in developing countries, but people are standing still. before the opportunity can completely eliminate hepatitis C virus.
    
    Three scientists Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice will equally share the prize money of more than 1 million USD for the annual Nobel Prize in biomedical science.</p>
