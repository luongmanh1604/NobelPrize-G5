                <h2>Emil Adolf von Behring</h2>
                <p>Nationality: German</p>
                <p>Award year: 1901</p>
                <p>Prize motivation: Prize motivation: For his work on serum therapy, especially its application against diphtheria, by which he has opened a new road
                    in the domain of medical science and thereby placed in the hands of the physician a victorious weapon against illness and deaths</p>
                <p class="cach">Emil Adolf von Behring, (born March 15, 1854, Hansdorf, West Prussia [now Ławice, Poland]—died March 31, 1917, 
                    Marburg, Germany), German bacteriologist who was one of the founders of immunology. In 1901 he received the first Nobel Prize 
                    for Physiology or Medicine for his work on serum therapy, particularly for its use in the treatment of diphtheria.</p>

        <h2>Education and early life</h2>
        <div id="content">

           <p class="cach">Behring was born in Hansdorf, Kreis Rosenberg, Province of Prussia (now Ławice, Iława County, Poland). His father was
             a schoolmaster; the family had 13 children.</p>
            <p class="cach">Between 1874 and 1878, he studied medicine at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Akademie in Berlin, an academy for military doctors,
                 since his family could not afford the university. As a military doctor, he studied the action of iodoform. Due to his work on
                  Neurotomia opticociliaris (or optociliary neurotomy), Behring became a doctor from the institute and later was able to pass his 
                  exam for licensed work in his area of Marburg. In 1878, his service required him to be sent to Poland where he focused on
                   septic diseases. His potential was becoming well known to many. This led to his commanded return to Prussia to study with
                    Robert Koch. He was employed by the military as he received his grants and money from the Prussian army. For each semester 
                    of education, he owed 1 year of service as a military surgeon. This accumulated to 2 years, from 1881 to 1883 as he served 
                    under the Second Hussar regiment. A lesser known part of his studies was his research in ophthalmology and how he furthered 
                    the understanding of the eye and its diseases. He wrote a paper during his time at Wicherkiewicz's hospital in Poznan from 
                    1881 to 1883 on an eye tumor case that ended up with the patient dying from leukemia, but it did allow for much needed 
                    research on treatments for the eye and what the preferred pathways for surgery would be. He learned under some of the great 
                    ophthalmologists like Carl Ernst Schweigger and Wilhelm Uhthoff, leading to his interest in the subject and his writing his
                     doctoral dissertation on it.</p>

        <div class="chu">
            <p class="cach">Behring received his medical degree in 1878 from the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Institut, the Prussian army’s medical 
                college, in Berlin. After serving 10 years with the Army Medical Corps, he became an assistant (1889) at the Institute for
                 Hygiene, Berlin, where Robert Koch was director. There, with the Japanese bacteriologist Kitasato Shibasaburo, he showed that 
                 it was possible to provide an animal with passive immunity against tetanus by injecting it with the blood serum of another animal
                  infected with the disease. Behring applied this antitoxin (a term he and Kitasato originated) technique to achieve immunity 
                  against diphtheria. Administration of diphtheria antitoxin, developed with Paul Ehrlich and first successfully marketed in 
                  1892, became a routine part of the treatment of the disease.</p>
            <p class="cach">Behring taught at Halle (1894) and in 1895 moved on to become director of the Institute of Hygiene at the Philipps 
                University of Marburg. He became financially involved with the Farbwerke Meister, Lucius und Brüning in Höchst, a dye works that
                 provided laboratories for his research, which included studies of tuberculosis. His writings include Die praktischen Ziele der
                  Blutserumtherapie (1892; “The Practical Goals of Blood Serum Therapy”).</p>   

            <p class="cach">In 1895 he became Professor of Hygienics within the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Marburg, a position 
                he would hold for the rest of his life. He and the pharmacologist Hans Horst Meyer had their laboratories in the same building, 
                and Behring stimulated Meyer's interest in the mode of action of tetanus toxin. </p>

    <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
    <p class="cach">Behring won the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901 for the development of serum therapies against 
        diphtheria. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1902.</p>
