                <h2>About the prize</h2>
                <p>The Nobel Prize in Physics is an annual prize awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to those who 
                    have made the most outstanding contributions to humanity in the field of physics. This is one of five Nobel
                    Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and began to be awarded in 1901, the remaining prizes 
                    are the Nobel Prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, and Physiology and Medicine. . Traditionally, physics 
                    is the first prize awarded during the Nobel Prize ceremony. German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen was the first 
                    recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in recognition of the extraordinary contributions he made to the  
                    discovery of X-rays. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and is considered the most prestigious 
                    award a scientist can receive in the field of physics. The prize was presented in Stockholm at an annual 
                    ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. As of 2022, a total of 221 individuals have received the award.</p>

                 receive a Nobel Prize, the first and only woman to have the honor of winning two Nobel Prizes in two different 
                 fields – physics and chemistry. She was also the first female university lecturer at the University of Paris (Sorbonne).
                  In 1995, her ashes were placed in memory at the Panthéon in Paris for her great contributions to humanity and the world.</p>

                The Nobel committee awarded the two scientists the prize for "their substantial contributions to the tests showing that 
                the neutrino (a type of subatomic particle produced by the decay of radioactive elements) This transformation requires 
                neutrinos to have mass." "This discovery has changed our understanding of the innermost workings of matter and could prove 
                crucial to our view of the universe." Kajita was born in 1959 in Higashimatsuyama, Saitama.[1] He is married to Michiko who

            <p>Alain Aspect born 15 June 1947 is a French physicist noted for his experimental work on quantum entanglement. Aspect was awarded the 
                2022 Nobel Prize in Physics, along with John Clauser and Anton Zeilinger , "for "experiments with entangled photons, establishing a 
                violation of Bell's inequality, and pioneering quantum information science".[6] The experiments were considered groundbreaking with 
                the entangled quantum state - when two particles act as a whole even when they are separated.Their results paved the way for new 
                technology based on quantum information. Alain Aspect was born in Agen. He received his doctorate from the University of Paris-Sud 
                in 1983, and is currently a professor at the University of Paris-Saclay and the Institut École Polytechnique.</p>
