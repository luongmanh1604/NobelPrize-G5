            <h2>About the prize</h2>
            <p>The Medical Noble Prize is the annual award of the Karolinska Institute.
                The first recipient of the Nobel Prize in Medicine was the German scientist Emil Adol
                f von Behring for "his discovery of serum substances, especially their use in the treatment
                of diphtheria". The prize was awarded to 8 studies on protein, 13 works on neuroscience and 13
                works related to metabolism in the body. First awarded in 1901, up to now, there have been 110 prizes awarded to
                 219 scientists around the world, the average age of the winning scientists is 58. In which, the youngest perso
                 n to win the prize is 58. Frederick G. Banting won the prize in 1923 at the age of 32, the oldest winner was 
                 Peyton Rous in 1966 at the age of 87. Among the winning scientists are 12 female scientists.</p>

        <p>Svante Pääbo (born April 20, 1955, Stockholm, Sweden) Swedish evolutionary geneticist who specialized in the study of DNA from 
            ancient specimens and who was the first to contribute to the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome. Pääbo also discovered the hominin 
            Denisova. For his groundbreaking research on hominin genomes and human evolution, Pääbo was awarded the 2022 Nobel Prize for

        <p>Harvey James Alter (born September 12, 1935, New York, New York) American physician and virologist known for his discoveries         
            pertaining to viruses that cause hepatitis, particularly his contributions to the discovery and isolation of hepatitis C virus (HCV). 
            His research laid the basis for the development of blood donor screening programs to prevent the transmission of hepatitis via blood 
            transfusion. For his discovery of HCV, he was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, shared with British-born virologist 
            Michael Houghton and American virologist Charles M. Rice.</p>
