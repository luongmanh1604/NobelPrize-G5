   <!-- Nobel prize-->

<section class="phan1">
 <div class="tt chinh">
    <p> <strong>The nobel prize</strong> is a set of international awards that have been awarded annually since 1901 
    to individuals who have made achievements in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine,
    literature, economics and peace; especially peace prizes can be awarded to organizations or to
    individuals.</p>
    <hr>
    <span>How was the nobel prize born?</span>
    <p>After his death in 1896, Alfred Nobel left behind a will that was shocking and confusing 
    for everyone when he gave only a small part of his fortune to friends and relatives so as to
    "not create enemies." lazy". Nearly all of his assets were sold for cash, equivalent to 70
    million Swedish krona at the time, to be deposited in the bank. The annual profit will be 
    extracted and divided into 5 prizes awarded "to those who have made the greatest contribution 
    to humanity" in the fields of: Physics, Chemistry, Biology (or Medicine), Literature, and Peace.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <span>How is the Nobel Prize awarded?</span>
    <p>Among the Nobel prizes, the Physics, Chemistry, Literature and Economics Prizes are decided by 
    the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; The Medicine Prize is decided by the Nobel Committee of the 
    Karolinska Institute; and the Peace Prize is decided by the Nobel Committee of the Norwegian 
    Parliament. In September of the year preceding the award year, the Nobel Committee secretly sends 
    nomination forms to 3,000 experts who are former Nobel laureates and members. of the awarding body, 
    experts in the field of physics, chemistry, biology or medicine, leading professors from many universities 
    and research institutes. February of the award year is the deadline. file together. The Nobel committee will
    screen and select the candidates. The panel then selects between 250-350 shortlisted for the next round. From
    March to May, experts evaluate the work of the candidates, after which the Nobel Committee nominates the 
    laureates to the Institute. The Academy chooses by majority vote. From June to August, the Nobel Committee 
    assembles the reports with the list of recommendations to send to the Academy. This report was jointly signed 
    by the council members. From September to early October, the Nobel Committee submitted their selections to the 
    Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and other awarding organisations. . In fact, the awarding unit does not always
    follow the recommendation of this Committee. In early October, the Academy selected the winners based on a
    majority of votes, then officially announced the names of the winners. won the prize. Voting to choose the Nobel 
    laureate was kept secret until the end. Every year, before November 15, the Organizing Committee will have to 
    announce the list of recipients of this noble award. According to the rules of the Nobel Committee, information 
    related to the awarding process is kept confidential for 50 years. A Nobel Prize is usually awarded to a maximum 
    of 3 people. If a prize is declined or not accepted, the bonus amount will be paid into the fund. The Nobel Prizes
    for Medicine, Physics, Chemistry, Literature, Economics are awarded in December in Stockholm, Sweden, and the Nobel 
    Peace Prize ceremony takes place in Oslo, Norway.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <span>How much is the Nobel Prize worth?</span>
    <p>Each award consists of a gold medal, a certificate of merit and a sum of money. The amount depends on the income 
    of the Nobel Society. Initially, more than three people could receive the same Nobel Prize, although this never happened. 
    The constitution of the Nobel Foundation was amended in 1968 to limit the number of co-recipients to only three people.
    In that case, each person can get 1/3 of the money or 2 people can split 50% of the bonus while the third person gets the 
    remaining 50%. Occasionally a Nobel Prize is withheld until the following year. If not yet awarded, the bonus amount will
    be returned to the fund. Therefore, two prizes of the same kind (for example, two physics prizes) can be awarded in one year.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>"The undersigned is Alfred Bernhard Nobel. I have given due thought and promulgated a Final Will regarding the disposal of 
    my estate after my death as follows:

    All that assets are converted to cash, which my agent will safely invest in securities and constitute a type of fund. 
    The profit of the fund is divided into 5 equal parts to reward those who have made the greatest contribution to the benefit 
    of mankind in the previous year, including: The person with the most important discovery or invention in the field of Materials 
    reason; The person with the most important discovery or improvement in the field of Chemistry; The person with the most important
    discovery in the field of Physiology or Medicine; The person who created the most outstanding literary work in the direction of
    idealism; The person who has made the greatest or best contribution to the promotion of friendly relations between countries, 
    the elimination or reduction of armaments, the army and in peace conferences.
      

    The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences considers awards for physics and chemistry; The Stockholm Medical Institute considers awards
    for physiology or medicine; The Swedish Literary Institute of Stockholm considers and awards literary prizes; The peace prize is 
    awarded by a committee of five people appointed by the Norwegian parliament.
      
    My clearest wish is this: when considering giving awards to the above-mentioned persons, there is absolutely no bias in regard to
    the person's nationality, regardless of whether they are Scandinavian or not (Sweden is on the other side). East of the Scandinavian 
    peninsula in Northern Europe - NV), just they deserve it.
      
    The establishment of the above awards is my most urgent desire.
      
    This is my only valid Will. After my death, if other previous wills are found to handle my property, those wills are invalid.
      
    Alfred Bernhard Nobel
      
    November 27, 1895"</p>
