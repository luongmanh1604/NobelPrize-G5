                <h2>Tonegawa Sumusu</h2>
                <p>Nationality: Japan</p>
                <p>Award year: 1987</p>
                <p>Prize motivation: For his discovery of the genetic principle for generation of antibody diversity</p>
                <p class="cach">Tonegawa Sumusu (born September 5, 1939) is a Japanese scientist who was the sole recipient of the Nobel 
                    Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1987 for his discovery of V(D)J recombination, the genetic mechanism which produces 
                    antibody diversity.[2] Although he won the Nobel Prize for his work in immunology, Tonegawa is a molecular biologist by 
                    training and he again changed fields following his Nobel Prize win; he now studies neuroscience, examining the molecular,
                     cellular and neuronal basis of memory formation and retrieval.</p>

            <p class="cach">Tonegawa was born in Nagoya, Japan and attended Hibiya High School in Tokyo. While a student at Kyoto University,
                 Tonegawa became fascinated with operon theory after reading papers by François Jacob and Jacques Monod, whom he credits in part 
                 for inspiring his interest in molecular biology. Tonegawa graduated from Kyoto University in 1963 and, due to limited options
                  for molecular biology study in Japan at the time, moved to the University of California, San Diego to do his doctorate study
                   under Dr. Masaki Hayashi. He received his Ph.D. in 1968.</p>

     <h2>Research and career</h2>

        <div class="chu">
            <p class="cach">Tonegawa earned a B.S. degree from Kyōto University in 1963 and a Ph.D. in molecular biology from the University 
                of California, San Diego, U.S., in 1969. He was a member of the Basel Institute for Immunology in Switzerland from 1971 to 1981. 
                During that time Tonegawa applied the newly devised recombinant DNA techniques of molecular biology to immunology and began to 
                tackle one of the greatest unsolved immunological questions of the day: how antibody diversity is generated. Prior to Tonegawa’s
                 discovery, it was unclear how a limited number of genes—there are believed to be about 100,000 in the human genome—could produce 
                 the total human antibody repertoire, which numbers in the trillions. According to Tonegawa’s research, each antibody protein is 
                 not encoded by a specific gene, as one theory contended; instead, antibodies are constructed from a relatively small number of
                  gene fragments that are rearranged randomly to generate different antibody molecules.</p>

            <p class="cach">In 1981 Tonegawa moved to the United States to become a professor of biology at the Center for Cancer Research at the
                 Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In addition to conducting immunological investigations, Tonegawa studied molecular 
                 and cellular aspects of neurobiology, and in 1994 he joined MIT’s Center for Learning and Memory (now the Picower Institute for 
                 Learning and Memory). His research focused on the role of the hippocampus in the processes of memory formation and recall. To 
                 conduct these studies, Tonegawa developed a genetically engineered mouse model in which the animals were no longer able to produce
                  an enzyme called calcineurin. Calcineurin plays important roles in the immune system and in the brain, where it is associated
                   with receptors that bind chemicals involved in neural synaptic transmission. Tonegawa’s mice unexpectedly displayed symptoms
                    characteristic of schizophrenia. Further studies indicated that genetic variations in the calcineurin gene contribute to the 
                    development of schizophrenia in humans. Tonegawa’s mouse model has since been employed for the discovery of pharmacological 
                    agents for the treatment of schizophrenia. Tonegawa also identified genes and proteins involved in long-term memory storage,
                     and he developed techniques to facilitate the study of neuronal circuits involved in cognition and behaviour.</p>

    <h2>Awards and honours</h2>
    <p class="cach">Tonegawa received numerous awards throughout his career, including the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize (1982), the Person of 
        Cultural Merit prize (Bunka Korosha; 1983), conferred by the Japanese government, and the Order of Culture (Bunka Kunsho; 1984).</p>
